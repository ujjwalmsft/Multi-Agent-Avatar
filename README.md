## Use Case Scenario

This code accelerator is specifically designed for architects and developers, particularly suited to healthcare environments where structured interactions and precise data capture are essential. For example, it effectively manages prescription workflows by capturing patient prescription details via structured question-and-answer interactions or document uploads. Once captured, the information is securely stored, and automated confirmations are communicated directly to patients and caregivers. Real-time i...

## Why Agentic AI and Multi-Agent Systems?

A key advantage of this solution lies in its utilization of an Agentic AI approach combined with multi-agent orchestration. Traditional Robotic Process Automation (RPA) systems often struggle to handle deviations or unexpected data inputs effectively. In contrast, the Agentic AI method dynamically adapts interactions based on conversational context. If initial user inputs are insufficient or incomplete, specialized agents proactively request additional information until all necessary requirements are fulfi...

Additionally, a multi-agent architecture significantly enhances modularity, scalability, and maintainability. Individual agents specialize in specific tasks or functions, enabling independent development, easier troubleshooting, and rapid adaptation to evolving business requirements or regulatory demands. This modular design reduces complexity, accelerates solution deployment, and simplifies ongoing maintenance and enhancements.
